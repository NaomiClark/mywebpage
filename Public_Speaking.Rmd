<br>

Passionate about the sharing and application of research, I continue to regularly engage with students and the wider public to bring to life recent findings surrounding Psychology and wellbeing, especially mindfulness.

I am continuously fascinated by science and its potential to be applied in our daily lives. Through this, I am passionate about bringing science out of the lab and into the streets, entertaining, educating and enthusing.

### Guest Speaker and Lecturer
I have previously spoken as a guest speaker at an undergraduate Positive Psychology course elective at the University of Glasgow, sharing my own experience with mindfulness as well as exploring the science and current developments in this active and interesting field. I introduced discussion points to tie in with course topics and lead a group meditation exercise.

I continue to engage in teaching, recently delivering a set of lectures on Qualitative methods as part of a research methods course at Glasgow Caledonian University, receiving positive feedback from both students and staff.

### Podcast Guest Host

Recently, I had the pleasure of being a guest on the Glasgow University Psychology Society's monthly podcast, 'Psych Soc O'Clock', to talk about the field of behaviour change and habit formation.
In this podcast, I shared my research experience in this field, disseminating results of my own and others' research in an informal, entertaining and accessible way.
