###Travelling
Outside of my Psychology projects, I am an avid international solo traveller, with my interests serving as my compass (sorry about the pun). My fascination with the German language has led me on many occasions to Germany and surrounding regions, inter-railing and volunteering, and my interest in mindfulness steered me into studying meditation at a Buddhist monastery in England. Keen to stretch myself further, I have also completed independent volunteer work in Canada.
