###Travelling
*Outside of the lab, I am an avid international solo traveller...*

To pursue my fascination with mindfulness, I volunteered and studied meditation at a Buddhist monastery in England and dream of trekking through Nepal in the near future. A keen interest in the German language has led me on many occasions through Germany and surrounding regions, inter-railing and volunteering, and once to a family in Canada.

My latest adventure saw me tour through Italy with friends, taking in Rome, Tuscany and Umbria.
