### Mindfulness, Wellbeing and Digital Applications

Working within an interdisciplinary team based at the [Centre for Computer Science Education](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/ccse/), University of Glasgow, I pursue the interdisciplinary application of mindfulness in tertiary education, working within Computing Science to assess impact on student learning and experience.

<br>

### Mindfulness and Behaviour Change

Building upon my undergraduate and postgraduate research projects, I continue to work with my supervisor [Prof. Lawrence Barsalou](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/psychology/staff/lawrencebarsalou/) on extending my investigation into the role of behavioural evaluations and self-control on influencing habitual behaviour, and observing the influence of trait mindfulness within this. 

<br>

### Student Wellbeing and Acute Mental Illness

Recently, I have begun working with Dr. Clive Kelly, a consultant in acute medicine at Newcastle University on a variety of topics involving student wellbeing and applications in East Africa.

<br>

###International Experience

I have worked and studied across Europe, undertaking a ERASMUS research assistantship during the summer of 2016 at the University of Tübingen, Germany in partnership with the [Leibniz-Institut für Wissensmedien](https://www.iwm-kmrc.de/www/index.html). Here I assisted [Dr. Hauke Meyerhoff](https://www.iwm-tuebingen.de/www/personen/ma.html?uid=hmeyerhoff) on investigations into the importance of auditory information in visual learning.

Wishing to learn more about the application of mindfulness, I independently sourced and secured a place at a summer school exploring the science of mindfulness and compassion at the [Univeristy of Amsterdam](http://www.uva.nl/en/home), the Netherlands. Here I was able to interact and discuss various topics within mindfulness and compassion with active researchers in the field, enriching my understanding and appreciation of the subject.
