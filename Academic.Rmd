Throughout my undergraduate degree, I developed a broad scope of knowledge for psychology as well as detailed understanding in areas of ageing, atypical development, social cognition and positive psychology. In recognition for my efforts not only in Psychology, but across all my additional courses, I received awards and prizes, including bursaries from the School of Modern Languages and Cultures and the School of Physics and Astronomy.

Undertaking this course has made me an effective researcher, enhancing my R coding proficiency and my knowledge of both quantitative and qualitative research methods, in addition to brain imaging techniques.
